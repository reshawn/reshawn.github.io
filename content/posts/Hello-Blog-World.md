For years I've been meaning to start a blog but never did, I think a big part of why is because I thought I wasn't good enough to write a blog about anything to do with tech. I kept reading more and more about the value of online presence and 'learning in public' but didn't think it was in my nature. 
Eventually I realized that I'm overthinking it, my blog doesn't need to be super new tutorials or advanced opinions on technology, it just needs to be *my own*. 
My own experiences, my own thoughts and lessons, my own notes to myself as a developer and person. Increasing online presence, learning in public, looking good for a job, those aren't the right reasons for me because then I won't enjoy doing this. 

The main goal is to show my future self my growth and progress over the years, so I can always come back here and find some motivation.

So yeah, hey! <span role="img" aria-label="sheep">ðŸ˜ƒ</span>
