I'm a software developer living in Trinidad & Tobago, currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science while working part-time as a VR software tester at a robotics company.

I grew up in Trinidad, completed secondary school a year early and placed top 10 in the Caribbean for some of the finishing exams before earning a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science at the University of the West Indies. While beginning my MSc I spent about half a year as a developer in enterprise software before becoming a VR software tester.

Since the beginning of my bachelors I've always been working on some personal project, usually something to do with food, human behaviour and mental health or social media and influencers.

My favourite video game right now is *Teamfight Tactics* and my favourite book is *The Alchemist*.
