I'm a software developer living in Trinidad & Tobago, currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science while working part-time as a tutor at the University of the West Indies. I'm also a member of a local research group, TTLab, and my current main interest is in data science.

I grew up in Trinidad, completed secondary school a year early and placed top 10 in the Caribbean for some of the finishing exams before earning a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science at the University of the West Indies. While beginning my MSc I spent about half a year as a developer in enterprise software before becoming a tutor and shifting focus to data science and research.

Since the beginning of my bachelors I've always been working on some personal project, usually something to do with food, human behaviour and mental health or social media and influencers.

My favourite video game right now is _Teamfight Tactics_ and my favourite book is _The Alchemist_.
